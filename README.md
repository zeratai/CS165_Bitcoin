We both worked on the project together during lab times and in the computer labs together as well.

For Part 1: We both watched documentation / youTube videos during lab hours and stayed afterwards
to begin working the code structure for TxHandler. After two lab sessions, we got an idea of
what needed to be accomplished and had already written down a few test cases. Following the second
lab session, we finished up part 1 (with a few minor bugs) later that evening at home. After
another day or so, we figured out the bug from deleting our old UTXOPool and completed all test results.

For Part 2: This one required more research from both parties and we both looked over and read each
of the files carefully. Drawing diagrams and workflow really helped us figure out what we needed
to do in order for us to handle the addBlock function within the Blockchain.java file. We spent an
entire day in the computer lab room working on part 2 together.
